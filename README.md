# ETL-Airflow
A simple ETL pipeline built with Apache Airflow to process Electric Vehicle (EV) data from Washington State. This pipeline fetches, transforms, and loads data into PostgreSQL, classifying vehicles as "recent" or "old" based on their model year. It's a smooth ride for your EV data, all automated to run daily! ðŸš™ðŸ’¨
